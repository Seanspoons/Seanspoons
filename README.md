### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Computing Science student at Simon Fraser University** and a **Data Engineer Co-op at Samsung R&D (Samsung Health)**, where I build and operate **production ETL pipelines** supporting global privacy and compliance metrics (GDPR, CCPA, CDPA, and more).

I enjoy working at the intersection of **data engineering, backend systems, and cloud infrastructure**, especially when it involves designing systems that are reliable, observable, and scalable in real-world production environments.

Alongside my co-op, I actively build and ship full-stack products and lead technical teams in open-source and community settings.
